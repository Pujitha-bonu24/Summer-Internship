 ROUTE PLANNING APPLICATION
 The Metro Route Optimization System presented in this project provides an efficient and userfriendly solution for navigating a metro network. The system is implemented using Java, focusing on
graph data structures and algorithms. It enables users to explore metro stations, find the shortest
distance, and calculate optimal travel routes based on both distance and time constraints.


1.Key Features:

1. Graph Representation: The metro network is modeled as a graph, where stations are
vertices and connections between stations are edges. This representation allows for efficient
navigation and pathfinding.
2. Dijkstra's Algorithm: The system employs Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest distance
and time paths between two metro stations. This algorithm ensures accurate and optimal route
planning for users.
3. Interactive User Interface: The system provides an interactive command-line interface,
allowing users to input station names, codes, or serial numbers for route planning. It also
displays a list of available actions for the users to choose from.
4. Station Codes: To enhance user experience, each station is associated with a unique code.
This feature simplifies user input and ensures a seamless interaction with the system.
5. Interchange Detection: The system identifies interchange stations where passengers can
switch between different metro lines. It calculates the number of interchanges and provides
detailed route information to the users.
6. Optimized Path Output: The system outputs optimized paths in a clear and structured
manner. It displays the starting station, intermediate stops, and the destination station, along
with the total distance or time required for the journey.

2.PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Urban metro networks often pose challenges to commuters, including complex routes, multiple
interchanges, and varying travel times. Navigating through these networks efficiently and making
informed decisions regarding optimal routes can be daunting for passengers. Existing metro
information systems may lack real-time updates and often do not consider user preferences, leading
to suboptimal travel experiences. Therefore, there is a pressing need for a comprehensive solution
that addresses these challenges and empowers commuters with accurate, real-time, and user-friendly
metro travel information.
